Based on the analysis conducted in this section, several key insights emerge regarding the composition of the provided data and its implications for the online learning platform.

The dataset comprises information on 3,676 courses, including details such as ID, title, URL, price, number of subscribers, number of reviews, number of lectures, learner's level, rating, content duration, subject, and publication date. Statistical summaries reveal important trends, such as the average price per course ($66), distribution of free and paid courses, and variations in course levels and subjects.

Further examination of specific variables reveals noteworthy patterns. For instance, the distribution of prices is positively skewed, with wider interquartile ranges observed for certain subjects like Web Development. The number of lectures and content duration also exhibit positively skewed distributions, indicating variation in course lengths. Notably, the number of reviews emerges as a significant factor influencing course popularity, suggesting the importance of encouraging learner feedback.

Correlation and regression analyses provide additional insights into the relationships between variables. Strong positive correlations are observed between the number of reviews and number of subscribers, as well as between content duration and number of lectures. Regression analysis highlights the number of reviews as a key predictor of subscriber numbers.

In conclusion, the analysis underscores the importance of factors such as pricing, course content, and learner feedback in shaping course engagement and subscriber numbers on the platform. Recommendations include advocating for increased reviews to boost course visibility, implementing measures to address potential misuse of review systems, and exploring subject-specific models for more accurate predictions. Additionally, future research should consider expanding the dataset to encompass a wider range of subjects to enhance data normalization and mitigate outlier effects.
